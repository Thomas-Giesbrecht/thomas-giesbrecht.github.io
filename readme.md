# Pokémon TCG Collection Tracker

A simple, client-side web application to track your Pokémon Trading Card Game collection for each set. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and designed to be hosted easily on GitHub Pages.

## Description

This tracker allows you to visually browse through different Pokémon TCG sets, view all the cards within them, and mark the ones you've collected. Your progress is saved directly in your browser using `localStorage`.

A key feature is the ability to export your collection progress for a specific set into a unique, compressed URL. You can access this via a convenient popup modal, copy the link to bookmark it, share it with friends, or use it as a personal backup. Opening an exported URL automatically loads the saved collection for that set, marking the cards visually.
